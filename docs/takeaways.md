## Key Insights from Production Runs

### 1. **Model Quantization Quality Impact**
**Observation**: Quantization affected Q&A generation quality noticeably
- **Hypothesis**: 8-bit quantization introduces precision loss that impacts reasoning quality
- **Need Data**: Compare BERT-scores between quantized vs full precision runs
- **Questions**: 
  - What's the quantitative quality drop? (BERT F1 difference)
  - Does it affect certain difficulty levels more than others?
  - Is the GPU memory savings worth the quality trade-off?

### 2. **Temperature as Quality Controller**  
**Observation**: Temperature was more crucial for answer selection than expected
- **Hypothesis**: Higher temperatures generate more diverse, potentially higher-quality responses
- **Need Data**: Quality scores by temperature (0.3 vs 0.7 vs 0.9) across difficulty levels
- **Questions**:
  - Which temperature produces highest RAG improvement scores?
  - Does optimal temperature vary by difficulty level?
  - Are "creative" answers actually better for technical domains?

### 3. **Sentence Transformer Model Selection Critical**
**Observation**: Choice of sentence transformer significantly impacted retrieval quality
- **Current**: Using `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` (384-dim, general purpose)
- **Hypothesis**: Domain-specific or larger models might perform better
- **Need Data**: Retrieval accuracy comparison across different embedding models
- **Questions**:
  - How does `all-mpnet-base-v2` (768-dim) compare?
  - Would domain-specific embeddings (audio/technical) help?
  - What's the speed vs accuracy trade-off?

### 4. **Prompt Engineering as Core Differentiator**
**Observation**: Prompt variations dramatically affect output quality
- **Hypothesis**: Wide prompt testing reveals non-obvious quality patterns
- **Need Data**: Quality metrics across different prompt templates
- **Questions**:
  - Which prompt structures produce most "answerable" questions?
  - Do domain-specific prompt templates outperform generic ones?
  - How sensitive is quality to minor prompt changes?

### 5. **Local Validation with CPU FAISS**
**Observation**: Having CPU-compatible outputs enables crucial local testing
- **Benefit**: Can iterate on selection algorithms without GPU costs
- **Need Data**: Performance comparison CPU vs GPU FAISS for retrieval accuracy
- **Questions**:
  - Is retrieval quality identical between CPU/GPU indices?
  - What's the speed difference for typical query loads?
  - Does index size affect CPU vs GPU performance differently?

### 6. **GPU Model Matching Beyond Cost**
**Observation**: Model size to GPU memory ratio affects more than just cost
- **Hypothesis**: Memory pressure impacts generation quality and consistency
- **Need Data**: Quality metrics at different GPU memory utilization levels
- **Questions**:
  - Does running near memory limits degrade quality?
  - Is there a sweet spot for memory utilization vs quality?
  - How does batch size interact with memory pressure?

### 7. **Serial vs Parallel Processing Trade-offs**
**Observation**: Serial processing had unexpected efficiency benefits
- **Hypothesis**: Model warmup costs and memory management favor serial runs
- **Need Data**: Total runtime and quality comparison serial vs parallel
- **Questions**:
  - What's the total time difference for full pipeline?
  - Does serial processing reduce GPU memory fragmentation?
  - Are quality scores more consistent in serial runs?

### 8. **Ground Truth vs Domain Questions Balance**
**Observation**: Domain-specific evaluation questions provide valuable quality signals
- **Hypothesis**: Domain questions reveal quality patterns ground truth might miss
- **Need Data**: Correlation between domain scores and actual training effectiveness
- **Questions**:
  - Do high domain scores predict better fine-tuning results?
  - Which matters more: BERT-score vs domain relevance?
  - Can domain scores replace expensive ground truth evaluation?

### 9. **Pair Selection as Quality Multiplier**
**Observation**: Quality selection algorithm has outsized impact on final dataset value
- **Hypothesis**: Better selection criteria could dramatically improve training outcomes
- **Need Data**: Training performance on datasets with different selection criteria
- **Questions**:
  - What selection threshold maximizes downstream model performance?
  - Should selection prioritize diversity or pure quality?
  - How does selection algorithm affect different model architectures?

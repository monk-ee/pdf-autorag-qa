You can use the UAFX Control mobile app to change footswitch assignments. In Live mode, the sound reflects the current positions of the knobs, switches, and LEDs on the pedal, and the left footswitch toggles the Live mode effect on/off. In Preset mode, you hear the settings that are stored as a preset, and the current positions of the knobs and switches do not reflect the sound. Instead, all knob and switch positions are internally set to their stored positions, and the right footswitch toggles the preset effect on/off. You can store a preset you\u2019ve created with your own settings by holding down the ALT/AMP/STORE switch until the green PRESET footswitch LED blinks rapidly (about 0.5 Live Mode To enter Live mode, press the left footswitch. Press the left footswitch again to toggle the effect on/off. The left footswitch LED is lit red when the Live mode effect is on. Preset Mode To enter Preset mode, press the right footswitch. Press the right footswitch again to toggle the preset on/off. The right footswitch LED is lit green when the preset is on. Note: The left and right footswitch functions can be changed in the UAFX Control mobile app. 23/05/2025, 11:35 UAFX Ruby '63 Top Boost Amplifier Manual \u2013 Universal Audio Support Home https://help.uaudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/6433175606420-UAFX-Ruby-63-Top-Boost-Amplifier-Manual Stored Preset You can store a preset on your UAFX pedal, and recall it using the right footswitch. All presets you store, and other artist and factory presets, are available in the UAFX Control mobile app. When you store a preset while in Live mode, the position of all knobs and switches on the pedal are saved. The preset also stores ALT knob positions, such as the alternate settings for the vibrato circuit. When you make a great sound in Live mode, storing it is as easy as holding down the ALT/AMP/STORE switch until the green PRESET footswitch LED blinks rapidly (about 0.5 When you store a preset while in Preset mode, only those knobs and switches that have changed since you loaded the preset are saved. So, when saving in Preset mode, what you hear is what is saved, and not the current positions of the knobs and switches. To store your sound as a preset Preset Notes The settings for Preset mode and Live mode are completely independent. When you move a knob or switch in Preset mode, the settings for the sound immediately jump to the new knob or switch position. You can view and audition all of your pedal\u2019s presets with the UAFX Control mobile app. Presets can only be stored when the pedal is not bypassed. Set your sound as you want it stored in the preset.

Volume Adjusts the amp\u2019s gain. As you increase volume, the character of the amp changes, becoming more overdriven and compressed. When the volume knob is set at the minimum, you will still hear sound from the pedal. The minimum level has been adjusted to provide the lowest amount of usable volume that the original hardware can provide. As you turn the volume knob up, the output volume is automatically adjusted to compensate. Note: This is the volume control on the original amp. For clean \u201cpost-amp\u201d volume adjustments, use the Output control. Cut Reduces high frequencies by filtering the power amp. As you rotate this knob clockwise, the amp tone becomes darker. Note: The range of the Cut knob has been adjusted to more easily find the 'sweet spot' for this control. The original hardware had a narrow range where the Cut knob had an audible effect. The amount of available Cut EQ is identical to the original amp, but the usable range for this knob has been expanded. Output Adjusts the output level from the pedal. When the Output volume is set at noon (running direct or into other pedals), it will be roughly the same level as your bypassed volume. 23/05/2025, 11:35 UAFX Ruby '63 Top Boost Amplifier Manual \u2013 Universal Audio Support Home https://help.uaudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/6433175606420-UAFX-Ruby-63-Top-Boost-Amplifier-Manual Output volume allows you to set the level for your setup. This control is not available on the original amplifier. Bass / Room Adjusts two different settings, depending on the position of the Alt / Amp / Store switch. AMP mode: Reduces the low frequency response of the amp\u2019s tone stack on the Brilliant channel only. ALT mode: Adjusts the amount of room tone mixed into the signal. Notes and tips Room amount only affects your sound when you use a speaker cabinet. When the speaker cabinet is bypassed, Room has no effect. The Speaker LED blinks rapidly to indicate the knob is inactive. Set Room to noon for a good starting point, and add or remove room to taste. Setting Room fully off is like recording your amp in an isolation booth. Turning up the Room knob adds ambience from the room microphones set up in the tracking room of a studio. There is no fully wet Room sound. Treble / Speed Adjusts two different settings, depending on the position of the Alt / Amp / Store switch. AMP mode: Reduces the high frequency response of the amp\u2019s tone stack on the Brilliant channel only. ALT mode: Adjusts the amp\u2019s vibrato speed. Notes The Bass and Treble knobs only work with the Brilliant channel, as with the original hardware. 23/05/2025, 11:35 UAFX Ruby '63 Top Boost Amplifier Manual \u2013 Universal Audio Support Home https://help.uaudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/6433175606420-UAFX-Ruby-63-Top-Boost-Amplifier-Manual The Bass and Treble knobs cut bass and treble frequencies as you rotate them clockwise (in effect, they work in reverse of most EQ knobs). As with the original tube amp, vibrato is only available when the Vibrato channel is selected. Bass and Treble use notes The bass and treble knobs are extremely interactive. When bass and treble are turned all the way up (all the way to the left), the midrange is reduced and the bass and treble are increased in a very extreme \u201csmiley-face\u201d EQ curve. Turn bass and treble up to around noon for more midrange and a more natural, flatter and fuller tone. A lot of usable sounds can be found by adjusting the bass and treble knobs to similar positions.

Speaker Type LED The currently selected speaker cabinet is indicated by this LED. A red LED indicates that the effect printed on the pedal is selected. A bonus speaker cabinet is selected when an LED is green (the bonus speaker cabinets don't have labels). When the LED is off, the amp is active but no speaker cabinet simulation is applied. Tip: When playing through a real guitar amplifier and speaker cabinet, you might want to bypass the speaker cabinet emulation by pressing the pedal's Speaker switch until its LED is unlit. Alt / Amp / Store In AMP mode, the standard knob controls are available for the amp. In ALT mode, room amount and vibrato speed and intensity controls are available on the Bass, Treble, and Boost knobs. To store a preset, press and hold the ALT/AMP/STORE switch in the down position until the green PRESET footswitch LED blinks rapidly (about 0.5 seconds). Channel Ruby '63 includes three channels, each of which provides different amp character and features. The boost type is also unique to each channel. Use the Channel switch to select the amp\u2019s input channel, and the Boost knob to push the input of the amp for more added gain. See Ruby '63 Channels for more details about the channels. NORMAL is based on the classic '61 \u201cnon-top-boost\u201d amplifier. The Boost knob adds gain from a germanium treble booster circuit to the amp\u2019s input. BRIL is the amp\u2019s Brilliant channel, based on the classic '63 \u201ctop-boost\u201d amplifier. The Boost knob adds gain from the preamp of an EP-III tape echo. 23/05/2025, 11:35 UAFX Ruby '63 Top Boost Amplifier Manual \u2013 Universal Audio Support Home https://help.uaudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/6433175606420-UAFX-Ruby-63-Top-Boost-Amplifier-Manual VIB is the amp\u2019s vibrato channel, based on the classic '63 \u201ctop-boost\u201d amplifier.

    "Here are four Q&A pairs that would help someone learn and understand the UAFX Ruby '63 Top Boost Amplifier:\n\nQ: What are the key features of the UAFX Ruby '63 Top Boost Amplifier, and how do they enable you to achieve authentic '60s British tube combo sounds?\nA: The UAFX Ruby '63 Top Boost Amplifier features a powerful dual-engine design that delivers authentic '60s British tube combo sounds. The pedal includes speaker cabinet, mic, and room tone emulations derived from the award-winning OX Amp Top Box, as well as a \"hot rod\" treble booster, preamp boost, and speaker swaps. These features allow you to tailor your tone to your liking and achieve a wide range of classic British amp sounds.\n\nQ: What is the difference between Live Mode and Preset Mode on the UAFX Ruby '63 Top Boost Amplifier, and how do you switch between them?\nA: Live Mode and Preset Mode are two operating modes on the UAFX Ruby '63 Top Boost Amplifier. In Live Mode, the pedal reflects the current positions of the knobs, switches, and LEDs on the pedal, and the left footswitch toggles the Live mode effect on/off. In Preset Mode, the pedal recalls the settings stored as a preset, and the right footswitch toggles the preset on/off. To switch between modes, press the left footswitch to enter Live Mode or the right footswitch to enter Preset Mode.\n\nQ: How do you store a preset on the UAFX Ruby '63 Top Boost Amplifier, and what information is saved when you store a preset?\nA: To store a preset on the UAFX Ruby '63 Top Boost Amplifier, press and hold the ALT/AMP/STORE switch until the green PRESET footswitch LED blinks rapidly (about 0.5 seconds). When you store a preset while in Live Mode, the position of all knobs and switches on the pedal are saved, as well as the alternate settings for the vibrato circuit. When you store a preset while in Preset Mode, only those knobs and switches that have changed since you loaded the preset are saved.\n\nQ: Can you explain the relationship between the UAFX Control software and the UAFX Ruby '63 Top Boost Amplifier, and how does it enhance your pedal experience?\nA: The UAFX Control software is a companion app that allows you to customize footswitches, recall and archive your presets, unlock additional features, download artist presets, and more.",
    "Here are 4 Q&A pairs that test application, analysis, and understanding of the relationships between concepts:\n\n**Q1:** What happens when you store a preset while in Preset mode, and how does this differ from storing a preset while in Live mode?\n\n**A1:** When you store a preset while in Preset mode, only those knobs and switches that have changed since you loaded the preset are saved. This means that the saved preset reflects the sound you hear at that moment, not the current positions of the knobs and switches. In contrast, when you store a preset while in Live mode, the entire sound is saved, including the current knob and switch settings.\n\n**Q2:** How do the Bass and Treble knobs interact with each other, and what is the effect of setting them both to the maximum?\n\n**A2:** The Bass and Treble knobs are extremely interactive, and when both are turned all the way up (to the left), the midrange is reduced and the bass and treble are increased in a very extreme \"smiley-face\" EQ curve. This creates a distinctive tone that is often described as \"full\" or \"fat.\" Setting both knobs to maximum can be useful for creating a specific sound, but it may not be suitable for every music genre or playing style.\n\n**Q3:** What is the purpose of the Cut knob, and how does it affect the sound?\n\n**A3:** The Cut knob reduces high frequencies by filtering the power amp, making the tone darker as you rotate it clockwise. The range of the Cut knob has been adjusted to more easily find the \"sweet spot\" for this control, making it easier to dial in a desired tone. The Cut knob is particularly useful for adding depth and warmth to the sound, especially when used in combination with the Bass and Treble knobs.\n\n**Q4:** How does the Output control differ from the volume control, and why is it useful?\n\n**A4:** The Output control adjusts the output level from the pedal, allowing you to set the level for your setup. This is distinct from the volume control, which adjusts the gain of the amp. The Output control is useful for setting the overall level of your sound, especially when using the pedal in a chain of effects or when recording. It allows you to maintain a consistent level while making adjustments to the gain and tone of the pedal.",
    "Here are 4 Q&A pairs that focus on application, analysis, and understanding relationships between concepts:\n\n**Q1:** How would you adjust the Bass and Treble knobs to achieve a more natural, flatter, and fuller tone?\n**A:** To achieve a more natural, flatter, and fuller tone, you would turn the Bass and Treble knobs up to around noon, which would reduce the midrange and increase the bass and treble in a balanced manner. This would create a more even frequency response and a fuller tone.\n\n**Q2:** What happens when you push the Alt / Amp / Store switch into AMP mode, and how does it affect the available controls?\n**A:** When you push the Alt / Amp / Store switch into AMP mode, the standard knob controls become available for the amp, allowing you to adjust the tone stack on the Brilliant channel only. The Bass and Treble knobs only work with the Brilliant channel, and the Boost knob adjusts the amount of boost applied to the amp circuitry.\n\n**Q3:** How does the Boost knob work differently on the VIB and BRIL channels compared to the NORMAL channel?\n**A:** On the VIB channel, the Boost knob adds clean boost to the amp's input, whereas on the BRIL channel, it adds gain from the preamp of an EP-III tape echo. On the NORMAL channel, the Boost knob adds gain from a germanium treble booster circuit to the amp's input.\n\n**Q4:** What is the purpose of the Speaker switch, and how does it relate to the LED indicator?\n**A:** The Speaker switch allows you to change the speaker cabinet and microphone, and the LED indicator shows the currently selected speaker cabinet. When the LED is red, it indicates that the effect printed on the pedal is selected, and when it's green, it indicates a bonus speaker cabinet is selected.",
    "Here are four Q&A pairs that test application, analysis, and understanding of relationships between concepts:\n\n**Q1:** What is the purpose of the boost knob on the Ruby '63 Top Boost Amplifier, and how does it affect the amp's sound?\n**A1:** The boost knob adds clean boost to the amp's input, allowing you to increase the amount of gain to the input of each channel. When the boost knob is turned up, it adds more gain and treble to the amp's sound, making it suitable for achieving a brighter, more aggressive tone.\n\n**Q2:** How do the different speaker cabinet options available in the Ruby '63 Top Boost Amplifier affect the overall sound of the amp, and what are the characteristics of each speaker cabinet?\n**A2:** The different speaker cabinet options available in the Ruby '63 Top Boost Amplifier provide distinct tonal variations. For example, the Silver cabinet has a high-end warmth and sheen, while the Blue cabinet has a classic speaker with more high-end and chime. The Green cabinet has a more midrange honk and tamer highs, while the Gold cabinet has a narrower sound with midrange forward and less high-end. Understanding the characteristics of each speaker cabinet can help you choose the one that best suits your playing style and tone preferences.\n\n**Q3:** What is the difference between the Live mode and Preset mode on the Ruby '63 Top Boost Amplifier, and how do they affect the amp's behavior?\n**A3:** The Live mode and Preset mode on the Ruby '63 Top Boost Amplifier are two different operating modes that can be toggled using the left footswitch. In Live mode, the amp is active and responds to the controls and settings you've chosen. In Preset mode, the amp recalls the stored settings and operates in a more automated fashion, allowing you to quickly switch between different sounds and settings.\n\n**Q4:** How do the footswitch modes on the Ruby '63 Top Boost Amplifier allow for more flexibility and control over the amp's behavior, and what are some scenarios where using different footswitch modes might be beneficial?\n**A4:** The footswitch modes on the Ruby '63 Top Boost Amplifier allow for more flexibility and control over the amp's behavior by enabling you to toggle different settings and features on and off using the footswitches. For example, you can use the footswitch to toggle the Live mode sound on and off, or to engage and disengage the boost circuitry. By using different"

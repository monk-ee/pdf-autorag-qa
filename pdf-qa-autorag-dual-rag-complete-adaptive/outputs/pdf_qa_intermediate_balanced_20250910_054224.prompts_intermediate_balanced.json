You can use the UAFX Control mobile app to change footswitch assignments. In Live mode, the sound reflects the current positions of the knobs, switches, and LEDs on the pedal, and the left footswitch toggles the Live mode effect on/off. In Preset mode, you hear the settings that are stored as a preset, and the current positions of the knobs and switches do not reflect the sound. Instead, all knob and switch positions are internally set to their stored positions, and the right footswitch toggles the preset effect on/off. You can store a preset you\u2019ve created with your own settings by holding down the ALT/AMP/STORE switch until the green PRESET footswitch LED blinks rapidly (about 0.5 Live Mode To enter Live mode, press the left footswitch. Press the left footswitch again to toggle the effect on/off. The left footswitch LED is lit red when the Live mode effect is on. Preset Mode To enter Preset mode, press the right footswitch. Press the right footswitch again to toggle the preset on/off. The right footswitch LED is lit green when the preset is on. Note: The left and right footswitch functions can be changed in the UAFX Control mobile app. 23/05/2025, 11:35 UAFX Ruby '63 Top Boost Amplifier Manual \u2013 Universal Audio Support Home https://help.uaudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/6433175606420-UAFX-Ruby-63-Top-Boost-Amplifier-Manual Stored Preset You can store a preset on your UAFX pedal, and recall it using the right footswitch. All presets you store, and other artist and factory presets, are available in the UAFX Control mobile app. When you store a preset while in Live mode, the position of all knobs and switches on the pedal are saved. The preset also stores ALT knob positions, such as the alternate settings for the vibrato circuit. When you make a great sound in Live mode, storing it is as easy as holding down the ALT/AMP/STORE switch until the green PRESET footswitch LED blinks rapidly (about 0.5 When you store a preset while in Preset mode, only those knobs and switches that have changed since you loaded the preset are saved. So, when saving in Preset mode, what you hear is what is saved, and not the current positions of the knobs and switches. To store your sound as a preset Preset Notes The settings for Preset mode and Live mode are completely independent. When you move a knob or switch in Preset mode, the settings for the sound immediately jump to the new knob or switch position. You can view and audition all of your pedal\u2019s presets with the UAFX Control mobile app. Presets can only be stored when the pedal is not bypassed. Set your sound as you want it stored in the preset.

Volume Adjusts the amp\u2019s gain. As you increase volume, the character of the amp changes, becoming more overdriven and compressed. When the volume knob is set at the minimum, you will still hear sound from the pedal. The minimum level has been adjusted to provide the lowest amount of usable volume that the original hardware can provide. As you turn the volume knob up, the output volume is automatically adjusted to compensate. Note: This is the volume control on the original amp. For clean \u201cpost-amp\u201d volume adjustments, use the Output control. Cut Reduces high frequencies by filtering the power amp. As you rotate this knob clockwise, the amp tone becomes darker. Note: The range of the Cut knob has been adjusted to more easily find the 'sweet spot' for this control. The original hardware had a narrow range where the Cut knob had an audible effect. The amount of available Cut EQ is identical to the original amp, but the usable range for this knob has been expanded. Output Adjusts the output level from the pedal. When the Output volume is set at noon (running direct or into other pedals), it will be roughly the same level as your bypassed volume. 23/05/2025, 11:35 UAFX Ruby '63 Top Boost Amplifier Manual \u2013 Universal Audio Support Home https://help.uaudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/6433175606420-UAFX-Ruby-63-Top-Boost-Amplifier-Manual Output volume allows you to set the level for your setup. This control is not available on the original amplifier. Bass / Room Adjusts two different settings, depending on the position of the Alt / Amp / Store switch. AMP mode: Reduces the low frequency response of the amp\u2019s tone stack on the Brilliant channel only. ALT mode: Adjusts the amount of room tone mixed into the signal. Notes and tips Room amount only affects your sound when you use a speaker cabinet. When the speaker cabinet is bypassed, Room has no effect. The Speaker LED blinks rapidly to indicate the knob is inactive. Set Room to noon for a good starting point, and add or remove room to taste. Setting Room fully off is like recording your amp in an isolation booth. Turning up the Room knob adds ambience from the room microphones set up in the tracking room of a studio. There is no fully wet Room sound. Treble / Speed Adjusts two different settings, depending on the position of the Alt / Amp / Store switch. AMP mode: Reduces the high frequency response of the amp\u2019s tone stack on the Brilliant channel only. ALT mode: Adjusts the amp\u2019s vibrato speed. Notes The Bass and Treble knobs only work with the Brilliant channel, as with the original hardware. 23/05/2025, 11:35 UAFX Ruby '63 Top Boost Amplifier Manual \u2013 Universal Audio Support Home https://help.uaudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/6433175606420-UAFX-Ruby-63-Top-Boost-Amplifier-Manual The Bass and Treble knobs cut bass and treble frequencies as you rotate them clockwise (in effect, they work in reverse of most EQ knobs). As with the original tube amp, vibrato is only available when the Vibrato channel is selected. Bass and Treble use notes The bass and treble knobs are extremely interactive. When bass and treble are turned all the way up (all the way to the left), the midrange is reduced and the bass and treble are increased in a very extreme \u201csmiley-face\u201d EQ curve. Turn bass and treble up to around noon for more midrange and a more natural, flatter and fuller tone. A lot of usable sounds can be found by adjusting the bass and treble knobs to similar positions.

Speaker Type LED The currently selected speaker cabinet is indicated by this LED. A red LED indicates that the effect printed on the pedal is selected. A bonus speaker cabinet is selected when an LED is green (the bonus speaker cabinets don't have labels). When the LED is off, the amp is active but no speaker cabinet simulation is applied. Tip: When playing through a real guitar amplifier and speaker cabinet, you might want to bypass the speaker cabinet emulation by pressing the pedal's Speaker switch until its LED is unlit. Alt / Amp / Store In AMP mode, the standard knob controls are available for the amp. In ALT mode, room amount and vibrato speed and intensity controls are available on the Bass, Treble, and Boost knobs. To store a preset, press and hold the ALT/AMP/STORE switch in the down position until the green PRESET footswitch LED blinks rapidly (about 0.5 seconds). Channel Ruby '63 includes three channels, each of which provides different amp character and features. The boost type is also unique to each channel. Use the Channel switch to select the amp\u2019s input channel, and the Boost knob to push the input of the amp for more added gain. See Ruby '63 Channels for more details about the channels. NORMAL is based on the classic '61 \u201cnon-top-boost\u201d amplifier. The Boost knob adds gain from a germanium treble booster circuit to the amp\u2019s input. BRIL is the amp\u2019s Brilliant channel, based on the classic '63 \u201ctop-boost\u201d amplifier. The Boost knob adds gain from the preamp of an EP-III tape echo. 23/05/2025, 11:35 UAFX Ruby '63 Top Boost Amplifier Manual \u2013 Universal Audio Support Home https://help.uaudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/6433175606420-UAFX-Ruby-63-Top-Boost-Amplifier-Manual VIB is the amp\u2019s vibrato channel, based on the classic '63 \u201ctop-boost\u201d amplifier.

To switch between modes, press the left footswitch for Live Mode and the right footswitch for Preset Mode.\n\n**Q3:** How do you store a preset on the UAFX Ruby '63 Top Boost Amplifier, and what happens to the knob and switch positions when storing a preset in Preset Mode?\n**A3:** To store a preset, press and hold the ALT/AMP/STORE switch in the down position until the green PRESET footswitch LED blinks rapidly (about 0.5 seconds). When storing a preset in Preset Mode, only the knobs and switches that have changed since loading the preset are saved, so what you hear is what is saved, not the current positions of the knobs and switches.\n\n**Q4:** What is the purpose of the UAFX Control software, and what features does it offer for managing your UAFX Ruby '63 Top Boost Amplifier?\n**A4:** The UAFX Control software is a companion app that allows you to register your pedal, get free bonus speaker cabinets and mics, update firmware, customize footswitches, recall and archive presets, unlock additional features, and download artist presets, making it a powerful tool for managing and customizing your UAFX Ruby '63 Top Boost Amplifier.",
    "Here are 4 Q&A pairs that test application, analysis, and understanding relationships between concepts:\n\n**Q1:** When storing a preset in Preset mode, what is saved and what is not saved?\n**A:** When storing a preset in Preset mode, only those knobs and switches that have changed since you loaded the preset are saved. What you hear is what is saved, and not the current positions of the knobs and switches.\n\n**Q2:** How do the Bass and Treble knobs interact with each other, and what is the effect of turning them up all the way?\n**A:** The Bass and Treble knobs are extremely interactive, and when turned up all the way, they create a \"smiley-face\" EQ curve, reducing midrange and increasing bass and treble frequencies. Turning them up to around noon provides a more natural, flatter, and fuller tone.\n\n**Q3:** Can you store a preset while the pedal is bypassed, and what happens if you try to do so?\n**A:** No, you cannot store a preset while the pedal is bypassed. If you try to store a preset while the pedal is bypassed, the preset will not be saved.\n\n**Q4:** How does the Output control differ from the Volume control, and what is the purpose of the Output control?\n**A:** The Output control adjusts the output level from the pedal, whereas the Volume control adjusts the gain of the amp. The Output control allows you to set the level for your setup, whereas the Volume control affects the tone and character of the amp.",
    "Here are four Q&A pairs that focus on application, analysis, and understanding relationships between concepts:\n\nQ: What is the primary function of the Bass and Treble knobs on the Ruby '63 Top Boost Amplifier?\nA: The Bass and Treble knobs on the Ruby '63 Top Boost Amplifier cut bass and treble frequencies as you rotate them clockwise, which can create an extreme \"smiley-face\" EQ curve when turned all the way up. This allows for a wide range of tonal adjustments and interactive control over the midrange.\n\nQ: How do the Boost and Intensity controls interact when in ALT mode?\nA: In ALT mode, the Boost control adjusts the amp's vibrato intensity, while the Intensity control allows you to bypass the vibrato circuit. This flexibility enables you to customize the vibrato effect to your preferences.\n\nQ: What happens when you push the Speaker switch repeatedly in the same direction on the Ruby '63 Top Boost Amplifier?\nA: When you push the Speaker switch repeatedly in the same direction, the pedal cycles through all available speaker cabinets, allowing you to select the desired cabinet simulation for your tone.\n\nQ: What is the purpose of the Alt / Amp / Store switch on the Ruby '63 Top Boost Amplifier?\nA: The Alt / Amp / Store switch allows you to switch between different modes, including AMP mode for standard knob control, ALT mode for adjusting room amount and vibrato speed/intensity, and Store mode for storing presets. This switch enables you to access a range of tonal options and customize your sound to suit your needs.",
    "Here are 4 Q&A pairs that test application, analysis, and understanding relationships between concepts:\n\nQ: How would you use the Ruby '63 Top Boost Amplifier's footswitch modes to control the boost and vibrato functions when using it as your main amplifier?\nA: To use the Ruby '63 Top Boost Amplifier as your main amplifier, I would use the footswitch modes to toggle the boost and vibrato functions on and off. For example, I could use the Live mode to toggle the boost and vibrato on and off, or use the Preset mode to toggle the preset sound on and off. This would allow me to have more control over the amplifier's functions and customize my sound to my preferences.\n\nQ: How do the different speaker cabinets in the Ruby '63 Speaker Cabinets section affect the sound of the amplifier?\nA: The different speaker cabinets in the Ruby '63 Speaker Cabinets section affect the sound of the amplifier by providing unique tonal characteristics. For example, the Silver Rare cabinet has a warm and bright sound, while the Blue Original cabinet has a classic sound with more high end. The Green Modern cabinet has a more aggressive sound with a focus on midrange honk and tamer highs. By selecting the right cabinet, I can achieve the desired tone and character for my music.\n\nQ: What is the purpose of the boost knob on the Ruby '63 Top Boost Amplifier, and how does it affect the amplifier's sound?\nA: The boost knob on the Ruby '63 Top Boost Amplifier adds clean gain to the input of each channel, allowing me to increase the overall gain and tone of the amplifier. By turning the boost knob clockwise, I can increase the gain and create a more aggressive sound. When the boost knob is turned all the way down to OFF, the boost circuitry is disabled and has no effect on the amplifier's sound.\n\nQ: How do the ALT mode knobs on the Ruby '63 Top Boost Amplifier affect the Vibrato circuit, and what does the Speaker LED indicate when the ALT mode knobs are active?\nA: The ALT mode knobs on the Ruby '63 Top Boost Amplifier control the Vibrato circuit, allowing me to adjust the speed and intensity of the vibrato effect. When the ALT mode knobs are active, the Speaker LED blinks rapidly to indicate that the Vibrato circuit is inactive. This allows me to easily switch between different vibrato settings and adjust the effect to my liking."

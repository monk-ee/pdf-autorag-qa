You can use the UAFX Control mobile app to change footswitch assignments. In Live mode, the sound reflects the current positions of the knobs, switches, and LEDs on the pedal, and the left footswitch toggles the Live mode effect on/off. In Preset mode, you hear the settings that are stored as a preset, and the current positions of the knobs and switches do not reflect the sound. Instead, all knob and switch positions are internally set to their stored positions, and the right footswitch toggles the preset effect on/off. You can store a preset you\u2019ve created with your own settings by holding down the ALT/AMP/STORE switch until the green PRESET footswitch LED blinks rapidly (about 0.5 Live Mode To enter Live mode, press the left footswitch. Press the left footswitch again to toggle the effect on/off. The left footswitch LED is lit red when the Live mode effect is on. Preset Mode To enter Preset mode, press the right footswitch. Press the right footswitch again to toggle the preset on/off. The right footswitch LED is lit green when the preset is on. Note: The left and right footswitch functions can be changed in the UAFX Control mobile app. 23/05/2025, 11:35 UAFX Ruby '63 Top Boost Amplifier Manual \u2013 Universal Audio Support Home https://help.uaudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/6433175606420-UAFX-Ruby-63-Top-Boost-Amplifier-Manual Stored Preset You can store a preset on your UAFX pedal, and recall it using the right footswitch. All presets you store, and other artist and factory presets, are available in the UAFX Control mobile app. When you store a preset while in Live mode, the position of all knobs and switches on the pedal are saved. The preset also stores ALT knob positions, such as the alternate settings for the vibrato circuit. When you make a great sound in Live mode, storing it is as easy as holding down the ALT/AMP/STORE switch until the green PRESET footswitch LED blinks rapidly (about 0.5 When you store a preset while in Preset mode, only those knobs and switches that have changed since you loaded the preset are saved. So, when saving in Preset mode, what you hear is what is saved, and not the current positions of the knobs and switches. To store your sound as a preset Preset Notes The settings for Preset mode and Live mode are completely independent. When you move a knob or switch in Preset mode, the settings for the sound immediately jump to the new knob or switch position. You can view and audition all of your pedal\u2019s presets with the UAFX Control mobile app. Presets can only be stored when the pedal is not bypassed. Set your sound as you want it stored in the preset. Press and hold the ALT/AMP/STORE switch in the down position until the green PRESET footswitch LED blinks rapidly (about 0.5 seconds). 23/05/2025, 11:35 UAFX Ruby '63 Top Boost Amplifier Manual \u2013 Universal Audio Support Home\n\nGenerate 2-4 Q&A pairs that would help someone learn and understand this material.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>",

Volume Adjusts the amp\u2019s gain. As you increase volume, the character of the amp changes, becoming more overdriven and compressed. When the volume knob is set at the minimum, you will still hear sound from the pedal. The minimum level has been adjusted to provide the lowest amount of usable volume that the original hardware can provide. As you turn the volume knob up, the output volume is automatically adjusted to compensate. Note: This is the volume control on the original amp. For clean \u201cpost-amp\u201d volume adjustments, use the Output control. Cut Reduces high frequencies by filtering the power amp. As you rotate this knob clockwise, the amp tone becomes darker. Note: The range of the Cut knob has been adjusted to more easily find the 'sweet spot' for this control. The original hardware had a narrow range where the Cut knob had an audible effect. The amount of available Cut EQ is identical to the original amp, but the usable range for this knob has been expanded. Output Adjusts the output level from the pedal. When the Output volume is set at noon (running direct or into other pedals), it will be roughly the same level as your bypassed volume. 23/05/2025, 11:35 UAFX Ruby '63 Top Boost Amplifier Manual \u2013 Universal Audio Support Home https://help.uaudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/6433175606420-UAFX-Ruby-63-Top-Boost-Amplifier-Manual Output volume allows you to set the level for your setup. This control is not available on the original amplifier. Bass / Room Adjusts two different settings, depending on the position of the Alt / Amp / Store switch. AMP mode: Reduces the low frequency response of the amp\u2019s tone stack on the Brilliant channel only. ALT mode: Adjusts the amount of room tone mixed into the signal. Notes and tips Room amount only affects your sound when you use a speaker cabinet. When the speaker cabinet is bypassed, Room has no effect. The Speaker LED blinks rapidly to indicate the knob is inactive. Set Room to noon for a good starting point, and add or remove room to taste. Setting Room fully off is like recording your amp in an isolation booth. Turning up the Room knob adds ambience from the room microphones set up in the tracking room of a studio. There is no fully wet Room sound. Treble / Speed Adjusts two different settings, depending on the position of the Alt / Amp / Store switch. AMP mode: Reduces the high frequency response of the amp\u2019s tone stack on the Brilliant channel only. ALT mode: Adjusts the amp\u2019s vibrato speed. Notes The Bass and Treble knobs only work with the Brilliant channel, as with the original hardware. 23/05/2025, 11:35 UAFX Ruby '63 Top Boost Amplifier Manual \u2013 Universal Audio Support Home https://help.uaudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/6433175606420-UAFX-Ruby-63-Top-Boost-Amplifier-Manual The Bass and Treble knobs cut bass and treble frequencies as you rotate them clockwise (in effect, they work in reverse of most EQ knobs). As with the original tube amp, vibrato is only available when the Vibrato channel is selected. Bass and Treble use notes The bass and treble knobs are extremely interactive. When bass and treble are turned all the way up (all the way to the left), the midrange is reduced and the bass and treble are increased in a very extreme \u201csmiley-face\u201d EQ curve. Turn bass and treble up to around noon for more midrange and a more natural, flatter and fuller tone. A lot of usable sounds can be found by adjusting the bass and treble knobs to similar positions.

Speaker Type LED The currently selected speaker cabinet is indicated by this LED. A red LED indicates that the effect printed on the pedal is selected. A bonus speaker cabinet is selected when an LED is green (the bonus speaker cabinets don't have labels). When the LED is off, the amp is active but no speaker cabinet simulation is applied. Tip: When playing through a real guitar amplifier and speaker cabinet, you might want to bypass the speaker cabinet emulation by pressing the pedal's Speaker switch until its LED is unlit. Alt / Amp / Store In AMP mode, the standard knob controls are available for the amp. In ALT mode, room amount and vibrato speed and intensity controls are available on the Bass, Treble, and Boost knobs. To store a preset, press and hold the ALT/AMP/STORE switch in the down position until the green PRESET footswitch LED blinks rapidly (about 0.5 seconds). Channel Ruby '63 includes three channels, each of which provides different amp character and features. The boost type is also unique to each channel. Use the Channel switch to select the amp\u2019s input channel, and the Boost knob to push the input of the amp for more added gain. See Ruby '63 Channels for more details about the channels. NORMAL is based on the classic '61 \u201cnon-top-boost\u201d amplifier. The Boost knob adds gain from a germanium treble booster circuit to the amp\u2019s input. BRIL is the amp\u2019s Brilliant channel, based on the classic '63 \u201ctop-boost\u201d amplifier. The Boost knob adds gain from the preamp of an EP-III tape echo. 23/05/2025, 11:35 UAFX Ruby '63 Top Boost Amplifier Manual \u2013 Universal Audio Support Home https://help.uaudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/6433175606420-UAFX-Ruby-63-Top-Boost-Amplifier-Manual VIB is the amp\u2019s vibrato channel, based on the classic '63 \u201ctop-boost\u201d amplifier.

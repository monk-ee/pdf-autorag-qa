You can use the UAFX Control mobile app to change footswitch assignments. In Live mode, the sound reflects the current positions of the knobs, switches, and LEDs on the pedal, and the left footswitch toggles the Live mode effect on/off. In Preset mode, you hear the settings that are stored as a preset, and the current positions of the knobs and switches do not reflect the sound. Instead, all knob and switch positions are internally set to their stored positions, and the right footswitch toggles the preset effect on/off. You can store a preset you\u2019ve created with your own settings by holding down the ALT/AMP/STORE switch until the green PRESET footswitch LED blinks rapidly (about 0.5 Live Mode To enter Live mode, press the left footswitch. Press the left footswitch again to toggle the effect on/off. The left footswitch LED is lit red when the Live mode effect is on. Preset Mode To enter Preset mode, press the right footswitch. Press the right footswitch again to toggle the preset on/off. The right footswitch LED is lit green when the preset is on. Note: The left and right footswitch functions can be changed in the UAFX Control mobile app. 23/05/2025, 11:35 UAFX Ruby '63 Top Boost Amplifier Manual \u2013 Universal Audio Support Home https://help.uaudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/6433175606420-UAFX-Ruby-63-Top-Boost-Amplifier-Manual Stored Preset You can store a preset on your UAFX pedal, and recall it using the right footswitch. All presets you store, and other artist and factory presets, are available in the UAFX Control mobile app. When you store a preset while in Live mode, the position of all knobs and switches on the pedal are saved. The preset also stores ALT knob positions, such as the alternate settings for the vibrato circuit. When you make a great sound in Live mode, storing it is as easy as holding down the ALT/AMP/STORE switch until the green PRESET footswitch LED blinks rapidly (about 0.5 When you store a preset while in Preset mode, only those knobs and switches that have changed since you loaded the preset are saved. So, when saving in Preset mode, what you hear is what is saved, and not the current positions of the knobs and switches. To store your sound as a preset Preset Notes The settings for Preset mode and Live mode are completely independent. When you move a knob or switch in Preset mode, the settings for the sound immediately jump to the new knob or switch position. You can view and audition all of your pedal\u2019s presets with the UAFX Control mobile app. Presets can only be stored when the pedal is not bypassed. Set your sound as you want it stored in the preset.

Volume Adjusts the amp\u2019s gain. As you increase volume, the character of the amp changes, becoming more overdriven and compressed. When the volume knob is set at the minimum, you will still hear sound from the pedal. The minimum level has been adjusted to provide the lowest amount of usable volume that the original hardware can provide. As you turn the volume knob up, the output volume is automatically adjusted to compensate. Note: This is the volume control on the original amp. For clean \u201cpost-amp\u201d volume adjustments, use the Output control. Cut Reduces high frequencies by filtering the power amp. As you rotate this knob clockwise, the amp tone becomes darker. Note: The range of the Cut knob has been adjusted to more easily find the 'sweet spot' for this control. The original hardware had a narrow range where the Cut knob had an audible effect. The amount of available Cut EQ is identical to the original amp, but the usable range for this knob has been expanded. Output Adjusts the output level from the pedal. When the Output volume is set at noon (running direct or into other pedals), it will be roughly the same level as your bypassed volume. 23/05/2025, 11:35 UAFX Ruby '63 Top Boost Amplifier Manual \u2013 Universal Audio Support Home https://help.uaudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/6433175606420-UAFX-Ruby-63-Top-Boost-Amplifier-Manual Output volume allows you to set the level for your setup. This control is not available on the original amplifier. Bass / Room Adjusts two different settings, depending on the position of the Alt / Amp / Store switch. AMP mode: Reduces the low frequency response of the amp\u2019s tone stack on the Brilliant channel only. ALT mode: Adjusts the amount of room tone mixed into the signal. Notes and tips Room amount only affects your sound when you use a speaker cabinet. When the speaker cabinet is bypassed, Room has no effect. The Speaker LED blinks rapidly to indicate the knob is inactive. Set Room to noon for a good starting point, and add or remove room to taste. Setting Room fully off is like recording your amp in an isolation booth. Turning up the Room knob adds ambience from the room microphones set up in the tracking room of a studio. There is no fully wet Room sound. Treble / Speed Adjusts two different settings, depending on the position of the Alt / Amp / Store switch. AMP mode: Reduces the high frequency response of the amp\u2019s tone stack on the Brilliant channel only. ALT mode: Adjusts the amp\u2019s vibrato speed. Notes The Bass and Treble knobs only work with the Brilliant channel, as with the original hardware. 23/05/2025, 11:35 UAFX Ruby '63 Top Boost Amplifier Manual \u2013 Universal Audio Support Home https://help.uaudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/6433175606420-UAFX-Ruby-63-Top-Boost-Amplifier-Manual The Bass and Treble knobs cut bass and treble frequencies as you rotate them clockwise (in effect, they work in reverse of most EQ knobs). As with the original tube amp, vibrato is only available when the Vibrato channel is selected. Bass and Treble use notes The bass and treble knobs are extremely interactive. When bass and treble are turned all the way up (all the way to the left), the midrange is reduced and the bass and treble are increased in a very extreme \u201csmiley-face\u201d EQ curve.

Speaker Type LED The currently selected speaker cabinet is indicated by this LED. A red LED indicates that the effect printed on the pedal is selected. A bonus speaker cabinet is selected when an LED is green (the bonus speaker cabinets don't have labels). When the LED is off, the amp is active but no speaker cabinet simulation is applied. Tip: When playing through a real guitar amplifier and speaker cabinet, you might want to bypass the speaker cabinet emulation by pressing the pedal's Speaker switch until its LED is unlit. Alt / Amp / Store In AMP mode, the standard knob controls are available for the amp. In ALT mode, room amount and vibrato speed and intensity controls are available on the Bass, Treble, and Boost knobs. To store a preset, press and hold the ALT/AMP/STORE switch in the down position until the green PRESET footswitch LED blinks rapidly (about 0.5 seconds). Channel Ruby '63 includes three channels, each of which provides different amp character and features. The boost type is also unique to each channel. Use the Channel switch to select the amp\u2019s input channel, and the Boost knob to push the input of the amp for more added gain. See Ruby '63 Channels for more details about the channels. NORMAL is based on the classic '61 \u201cnon-top-boost\u201d amplifier. The Boost knob adds gain from a germanium treble booster circuit to the amp\u2019s input. BRIL is the amp\u2019s Brilliant channel, based on the classic '63 \u201ctop-boost\u201d amplifier. The Boost knob adds gain from the preamp of an EP-III tape echo. 23/05/2025, 11:35 UAFX Ruby '63 Top Boost Amplifier Manual \u2013 Universal Audio Support Home https://help.uaudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/6433175606420-UAFX-Ruby-63-Top-Boost-Amplifier-Manual VIB is the amp\u2019s vibrato channel, based on the classic '63 \u201ctop-boost\u201d amplifier.

    "Here are 4 Q&A pairs that require synthesis, evaluation, critical thinking, and higher-order cognitive skills:\n\nQ: How do the Bass and Treble knobs interact with each other, and what are the implications for tone shaping?\nA: The Bass and Treble knobs are extremely interactive, meaning that when one is turned up, the other is affected. When both are turned all the way up, the midrange is reduced and the bass and treble are increased in a \"smiley-face\" EQ curve. This interaction allows for a wide range of tone shaping possibilities, but it also means that adjustments to one knob can have unintended consequences on the other. To achieve a more natural, flatter tone, it's recommended to turn both knobs up to around noon, which will reduce the extreme \"smiley-face\" EQ curve and allow for more midrange presence.\n\nQ: How does the Output control differ from the Volume control, and what are the implications for setting your sound?\nA: The Output control adjusts the output level from the pedal, whereas the Volume control adjusts the gain of the amp. This means that the Output control is used to set the overall level of your sound, whereas the Volume control is used to adjust the gain of the amp. When setting your sound, it's important to consider both the Output and Volume controls to achieve the desired level and tone. For example, if you're using the pedal in a live setting, you may want to set the Output control to a higher level to ensure that your sound cuts through the mix, while keeping the Volume control low to avoid distortion.\n\nQ: What are the implications of storing a preset in Preset mode, and how does it differ from storing a preset in Live mode?\nA: When storing a preset in Preset mode, only the knobs and switches that have changed since you loaded the preset are saved. This means that if you make changes to the knobs and switches while in Preset mode, those changes will be saved as part of the preset. In contrast, when storing a preset in Live mode, the entire state of the pedal is saved, including the positions of all knobs and switches. This allows for more flexibility when creating and editing presets, but it also means that you'll need to be careful not to make unintended changes to the pedal while in Live mode.\n\nQ: How does the Ruby '63's Cut control differ from a typical EQ control, and what are the implications for tone shaping?\nA: The Cut control reduces high frequencies by filtering the power amp,",
    "Here are four Q&A pairs that focus on synthesis, evaluation, critical thinking, and higher-order cognitive skills:\n\nQ: How do the Bass and Treble knobs on the Ruby '63 Top Boost Amplifier interact with each other, and what effect does this have on the overall tone?\nA: The Bass and Treble knobs on the Ruby '63 Top Boost Amplifier are extremely interactive, meaning that adjusting one knob affects the other. When both knobs are turned all the way up, the midrange is reduced, and the bass and treble are increased in a very extreme \"smiley-face\" EQ curve. This can result in a bright and aggressive tone. However, turning both knobs up to around noon can produce a more natural, flatter, and fuller tone with a balanced midrange. This interaction allows for a wide range of tonal possibilities, and finding the right balance can be a matter of personal preference.\n\nQ: What are the advantages and disadvantages of using the Ruby '63 Top Boost Amplifier's ALT mode, and how does it differ from the standard AMP mode?\nA: ALT mode allows for adjusting the amp's vibrato speed and intensity, which can add a unique texture to the sound. However, this mode is only available when the Vibrato channel is selected, and the Bass and Treble knobs are limited to controlling vibrato intensity. In contrast, AMP mode provides access to the standard knob controls, including the Bass, Treble, and Boost knobs. The choice between ALT and AMP modes depends on the desired tone and the type of music being played. For example, ALT mode might be suitable for adding a vintage vibe to a song, while AMP mode would be better for a more traditional tone.\n\nQ: How can the Ruby '63 Top Boost Amplifier's Boost knob be used to add gain to the signal, and what are the differences between the three channels (NORMAL, BRIL, and VIB)?\nA: The Boost knob can be used to add gain to the signal, and the type of gain depends on the selected channel. In the NORMAL channel, the Boost knob adds gain from a germanium treble booster circuit to the amp's input, while in the BRIL channel, it adds gain from the preamp of an EP-III tape echo. The VIB channel, on the other hand, uses clean boost to add gain to the amp's input. Each channel has its unique character and features, and choosing the right channel depends on the desired tone and the type of music being played.",

This channel has less headroom before breakup and more gain overall, making it suitable for players who want a more aggressive, overdriven sound. In contrast, the Ruby '63 channel is designed to emulate the classic tone of a 1963 amplifier, with a more balanced EQ and a slightly cleaner sound. The Ruby '63 channel also features a vibrato circuit, which can add a unique, dynamic quality to the sound. By understanding the differences between the channels, players can choose the one that best suits their musical style and preferences.\n\nQ: How do the speaker cabinet options in the Ruby '63 Top Boost Amplifier affect the overall sound and tone of the amplifier?\nA: The Ruby '63 Top Boost Amplifier offers a range of speaker cabinet options, each with its own unique characteristics and tonal profile. For example, the Silver and Blue cabinets provide a bright, chimey sound with a lot of high-end clarity, while the Green cabinet offers a warmer, more midrange-forward tone. The Gold cabinet, with its narrower sound and midrange emphasis, is ideal for players who want a more vintage-inspired tone. By selecting the right speaker cabinet, players can tailor their sound to suit their musical style and preferences, whether they're playing rock, blues, or other genres.\n\nQ: What are the advantages and limitations of using"

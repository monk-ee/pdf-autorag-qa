    "input": "",
    "output": "The interactive nature of the Bass and Treble knobs means that adjusting one knob can affect the other, creating a unique and complex tone-shaping experience. Working in reverse of most EQ knobs also requires a different approach to tone-shaping, as traditional EQ boosts and cuts are not applicable. This requires the user to think creatively and experiment with different settings to achieve the desired tone.",

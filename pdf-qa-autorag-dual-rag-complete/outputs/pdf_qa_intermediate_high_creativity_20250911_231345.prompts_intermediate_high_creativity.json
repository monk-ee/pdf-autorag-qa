You can use the UAFX Control mobile app to change footswitch assignments. In Live mode, the sound reflects the current positions of the knobs, switches, and LEDs on the pedal, and the left footswitch toggles the Live mode effect on/off. In Preset mode, you hear the settings that are stored as a preset, and the current positions of the knobs and switches do not reflect the sound. Instead, all knob and switch positions are internally set to their stored positions, and the right footswitch toggles the preset effect on/off. You can store a preset you\u2019ve created with your own settings by holding down the ALT/AMP/STORE switch until the green PRESET footswitch LED blinks rapidly (about 0.5 Live Mode To enter Live mode, press the left footswitch. Press the left footswitch again to toggle the effect on/off. The left footswitch LED is lit red when the Live mode effect is on. Preset Mode To enter Preset mode, press the right footswitch. Press the right footswitch again to toggle the preset on/off. The right footswitch LED is lit green when the preset is on. Note: The left and right footswitch functions can be changed in the UAFX Control mobile app. 23/05/2025, 11:35 UAFX Ruby '63 Top Boost Amplifier Manual \u2013 Universal Audio Support Home https://help.uaudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/6433175606420-UAFX-Ruby-63-Top-Boost-Amplifier-Manual Stored Preset You can store a preset on your UAFX pedal, and recall it using the right footswitch. All presets you store, and other artist and factory presets, are available in the UAFX Control mobile app. When you store a preset while in Live mode, the position of all knobs and switches on the pedal are saved. The preset also stores ALT knob positions, such as the alternate settings for the vibrato circuit. When you make a great sound in Live mode, storing it is as easy as holding down the ALT/AMP/STORE switch until the green PRESET footswitch LED blinks rapidly (about 0.5 When you store a preset while in Preset mode, only those knobs and switches that have changed since you loaded the preset are saved. So, when saving in Preset mode, what you hear is what is saved, and not the current positions of the knobs and switches. To store your sound as a preset Preset Notes The settings for Preset mode and Live mode are completely independent. When you move a knob or switch in Preset mode, the settings for the sound immediately jump to the new knob or switch position. You can view and audition all of your pedal\u2019s presets with the UAFX Control mobile app. Presets can only be stored when the pedal is not bypassed. Set your sound as you want it stored in the preset.

Volume Adjusts the amp\u2019s gain. As you increase volume, the character of the amp changes, becoming more overdriven and compressed. When the volume knob is set at the minimum, you will still hear sound from the pedal. The minimum level has been adjusted to provide the lowest amount of usable volume that the original hardware can provide. As you turn the volume knob up, the output volume is automatically adjusted to compensate. Note: This is the volume control on the original amp. For clean \u201cpost-amp\u201d volume adjustments, use the Output control. Cut Reduces high frequencies by filtering the power amp. As you rotate this knob clockwise, the amp tone becomes darker. Note: The range of the Cut knob has been adjusted to more easily find the 'sweet spot' for this control. The original hardware had a narrow range where the Cut knob had an audible effect. The amount of available Cut EQ is identical to the original amp, but the usable range for this knob has been expanded. Output Adjusts the output level from the pedal. When the Output volume is set at noon (running direct or into other pedals), it will be roughly the same level as your bypassed volume. 23/05/2025, 11:35 UAFX Ruby '63 Top Boost Amplifier Manual \u2013 Universal Audio Support Home https://help.uaudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/6433175606420-UAFX-Ruby-63-Top-Boost-Amplifier-Manual Output volume allows you to set the level for your setup. This control is not available on the original amplifier. Bass / Room Adjusts two different settings, depending on the position of the Alt / Amp / Store switch. AMP mode: Reduces the low frequency response of the amp\u2019s tone stack on the Brilliant channel only. ALT mode: Adjusts the amount of room tone mixed into the signal. Notes and tips Room amount only affects your sound when you use a speaker cabinet. When the speaker cabinet is bypassed, Room has no effect. The Speaker LED blinks rapidly to indicate the knob is inactive. Set Room to noon for a good starting point, and add or remove room to taste. Setting Room fully off is like recording your amp in an isolation booth. Turning up the Room knob adds ambience from the room microphones set up in the tracking room of a studio. There is no fully wet Room sound. Treble / Speed Adjusts two different settings, depending on the position of the Alt / Amp / Store switch. AMP mode: Reduces the high frequency response of the amp\u2019s tone stack on the Brilliant channel only. ALT mode: Adjusts the amp\u2019s vibrato speed. Notes The Bass and Treble knobs only work with the Brilliant channel, as with the original hardware. 23/05/2025, 11:35 UAFX Ruby '63 Top Boost Amplifier Manual \u2013 Universal Audio Support Home https://help.uaudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/6433175606420-UAFX-Ruby-63-Top-Boost-Amplifier-Manual The Bass and Treble knobs cut bass and treble frequencies as you rotate them clockwise (in effect, they work in reverse of most EQ knobs). As with the original tube amp, vibrato is only available when the Vibrato channel is selected. Bass and Treble use notes The bass and treble knobs are extremely interactive. When bass and treble are turned all the way up (all the way to the left), the midrange is reduced and the bass and treble are increased in a very extreme \u201csmiley-face\u201d EQ curve. Turn bass and treble up to around noon for more midrange and a more natural, flatter and fuller tone. A lot of usable sounds can be found by adjusting the bass and treble knobs to similar positions.

Speaker Type LED The currently selected speaker cabinet is indicated by this LED. A red LED indicates that the effect printed on the pedal is selected. A bonus speaker cabinet is selected when an LED is green (the bonus speaker cabinets don't have labels). When the LED is off, the amp is active but no speaker cabinet simulation is applied. Tip: When playing through a real guitar amplifier and speaker cabinet, you might want to bypass the speaker cabinet emulation by pressing the pedal's Speaker switch until its LED is unlit. Alt / Amp / Store In AMP mode, the standard knob controls are available for the amp. In ALT mode, room amount and vibrato speed and intensity controls are available on the Bass, Treble, and Boost knobs. To store a preset, press and hold the ALT/AMP/STORE switch in the down position until the green PRESET footswitch LED blinks rapidly (about 0.5 seconds). Channel Ruby '63 includes three channels, each of which provides different amp character and features. The boost type is also unique to each channel. Use the Channel switch to select the amp\u2019s input channel, and the Boost knob to push the input of the amp for more added gain. See Ruby '63 Channels for more details about the channels. NORMAL is based on the classic '61 \u201cnon-top-boost\u201d amplifier. The Boost knob adds gain from a germanium treble booster circuit to the amp\u2019s input. BRIL is the amp\u2019s Brilliant channel, based on the classic '63 \u201ctop-boost\u201d amplifier. The Boost knob adds gain from the preamp of an EP-III tape echo. 23/05/2025, 11:35 UAFX Ruby '63 Top Boost Amplifier Manual \u2013 Universal Audio Support Home https://help.uaudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/6433175606420-UAFX-Ruby-63-Top-Boost-Amplifier-Manual VIB is the amp\u2019s vibrato channel, based on the classic '63 \u201ctop-boost\u201d amplifier.

This design allows for a high degree of flexibility and customization, as users can adjust the tone to suit their individual preferences. The dual-engine processing also enables the pedal to deliver a wide range of tonal options, from clean and articulate to overdriven and distorted.\n\nQ: How can users customize and expand the capabilities of the Ruby '63 pedal, and what is the UAFX Control app used for?\nA: Users can customize and expand the capabilities of the Ruby '63 pedal using the UAFX Control app, which allows them to customize footswitches, recall and archive presets, unlock additional features, download artist presets, and more. The app also enables users to download free additional speaker cabinets and mics, giving them even more tonal options.",
    "Here are 4 Q&A pairs that test application, analysis, and understanding of the concepts:\n\n**Q1: How can you use the UAFX Ruby '63 Top Boost Amplifier to customize your tone?**\nA1: You can use the pedal's knobs and switches to adjust the tone in real-time in Live mode, and then store your preferred settings as a preset using the ALT/AMP/STORE switch. You can also use the UAFX Control mobile app to change footswitch assignments, customize presets, and download artist presets.\n\n**Q2: How do the Live and Preset modes differ in terms of how they affect the pedal's behavior?**\nA2: In Live mode, the pedal's sound reflects the current positions of the knobs, switches, and LEDs on the pedal, and the left footswitch toggles the effect on/off. In Preset mode, the pedal plays back the stored preset settings, and the right footswitch toggles the preset on/off. This allows you to switch between different tone settings quickly and easily.\n\n**Q3: What happens when you store a preset in Live mode, and what happens when you store a preset in Preset mode?**\nA3: When you store a preset in Live mode, the position of all knobs and switches on the pedal are saved, including the ALT knob positions. When you store a preset in Preset mode, only the knobs and switches that have changed since you loaded the preset are saved, so you can capture the exact sound you hear.\n\n**Q4: How do you access and manage your stored presets on the UAFX Ruby '63 Top Boost Amplifier?**\nA4: You can access and manage your stored presets using the UAFX Control mobile app, where you can view, audition, and organize your presets. You can also use the app to change footswitch assignments, download artist presets, and update firmware.",
    "Here are four Q&A pairs that focus on application, analysis, and understanding relationships between concepts:\n\nQ: When storing a preset in Preset mode, what is saved?\nA: When storing a preset in Preset mode, only those knobs and switches that have changed since you loaded the preset are saved. This means that what you hear is what is saved, and not the current positions of the knobs and switches.\n\nQ: How do the settings for Preset mode and Live mode differ?\nA: The settings for Preset mode and Live mode are completely independent. This means that changes made to the pedal in Preset mode will not affect the sound in Live mode, and vice versa.\n\nQ: What happens when you adjust the Bass and Treble knobs in ALT mode?\nA: When you adjust the Bass and Treble knobs in ALT mode, you are adjusting the amp's vibrato speed and room tone mixed into the signal, respectively.\n\nQ: Why do the Bass and Treble knobs cut bass and treble frequencies as you rotate them clockwise?\nA: The Bass and Treble knobs cut bass and treble frequencies as you rotate them clockwise because they work in reverse of most EQ knobs, similar to the original tube amp. This allows for a more unique and interactive EQ curve.",
    "Here are 4 Q&A pairs that test application, analysis, and understanding relationships between concepts:\n\n**Q1:** When using the Ruby '63 Top Boost Amplifier, how would you adjust the Bass and Treble knobs to achieve a more natural, flatter, and fuller tone?\n**A:** To achieve a more natural, flatter, and fuller tone, I would turn the Bass and Treble knobs up to around noon, which would reduce the midrange and increase the bass and treble in a more balanced manner, resulting in a more natural sound.\n\n**Q2:** What happens when you push the Alt/Amp/Store switch to ALT mode, and how does it affect the Bass, Treble, and Boost knobs?\n**A:** When you push the Alt/Amp/Store switch to ALT mode, the Bass, Treble, and Boost knobs become interactive, allowing you to adjust the amp's vibrato speed and intensity. This mode also provides a different set of controls for room amount and vibrato speed and intensity.\n\n**Q3:** How do the Bass and Treble knobs interact with each other, and what is the effect of rotating them to the extreme positions?\n**A:** The Bass and Treble knobs are extremely interactive, meaning that adjusting one knob affects the other. When both knobs are turned all the way up, the midrange is reduced, and the bass and treble are increased in a very extreme \"smiley-face\" EQ curve. This can result in an unbalanced sound, but finding the right balance by turning them to around noon can produce a more natural, flatter, and fuller tone.\n\n**Q4:** What is the purpose of the Boost knob, and how does it affect the sound in different modes?\n**A:** The Boost knob adjusts the amount of boost applied to the amp circuitry. In NORMAL mode, it adds gain from a germanium treble booster circuit to the amp's input. In BRIL mode, it adds gain from the preamp of an EP-III tape echo, while in VIB mode, it adds clean boost to the amp's input. The Boost knob can be used to add gain and shape the sound in various ways depending on the mode and channel selected.",
    "Here are 4 Q&A pairs that test application, analysis, and understanding relationships between concepts:\n\nQ: How can you use the UAFX Control mobile app to customize the operation of the Ruby '63 Top Boost Amplifier's footswitches?\nA: With the UAFX Control mobile app, you can change the operation of the pedal and footswitches for your amplifier setup and performance preferences. For example, you can use a footswitch mode to toggle boost and vibrato on and off. For more details about footswitch modes and how to enable them, see the UAFX Control Mobile App Manual.\n\nQ: What is the purpose of the Boost knob on the Ruby '63 Amplifier, and how does it affect the sound?\nA: The Boost knob adds clean boost to the amp's input. Rotating the Boost knob clockwise increases the amount of gain to the input of each channel, allowing for more gain overall and more treble. When the boost knob is turned all the way down to OFF, the boost circuitry is disabled and has no effect on amp color and gain.\n\nQ: How do the speaker cabinets in the Ruby '63 Speaker Cabinets section affect the sound of the amplifier?\nA: Each speaker, cabinet, and mic setting has a unique sound. The speaker cabinets can be toggled up or down through the list with the Speaker switch. When the speaker LED is green, the active speaker name is visible in the UAFX Control mobile app.\n\nQ: What is the difference between the Brilliant and other channels on the Ruby '63 Amplifier, and how do they affect the sound?\nA: The Brilliant channel is based on a '63 \u201ctop-boost\u201d amplifier and has less headroom before breakup and more gain overall compared to the other channels. The circuit incorporates an extra tube for more gain and more treble. The Cut, Bass, and Treble knobs provide EQ for the Brilliant channel, and the Vibrato circuit is disabled."

The Brilliant channel is based on a '63 \"top-boost\" amplifier, with an extra tube for more gain and treble, while the Normal channel is based on a '61 \"non-top-boost\" amplifier with more headroom and lower overall gain. The Vibrato channel is also based on a '63 \"top-boost\" amplifier, but with a unique set of inputs and a distinct sound. The key differences between the channels are the amount of gain, treble, and bass, as well as the presence or absence of the Vibrato circuit.

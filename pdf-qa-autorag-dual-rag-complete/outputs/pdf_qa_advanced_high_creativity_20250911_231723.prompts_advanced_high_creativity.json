You can use the UAFX Control mobile app to change footswitch assignments. In Live mode, the sound reflects the current positions of the knobs, switches, and LEDs on the pedal, and the left footswitch toggles the Live mode effect on/off. In Preset mode, you hear the settings that are stored as a preset, and the current positions of the knobs and switches do not reflect the sound. Instead, all knob and switch positions are internally set to their stored positions, and the right footswitch toggles the preset effect on/off. You can store a preset you\u2019ve created with your own settings by holding down the ALT/AMP/STORE switch until the green PRESET footswitch LED blinks rapidly (about 0.5 Live Mode To enter Live mode, press the left footswitch. Press the left footswitch again to toggle the effect on/off. The left footswitch LED is lit red when the Live mode effect is on. Preset Mode To enter Preset mode, press the right footswitch. Press the right footswitch again to toggle the preset on/off. The right footswitch LED is lit green when the preset is on. Note: The left and right footswitch functions can be changed in the UAFX Control mobile app. 23/05/2025, 11:35 UAFX Ruby '63 Top Boost Amplifier Manual \u2013 Universal Audio Support Home https://help.uaudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/6433175606420-UAFX-Ruby-63-Top-Boost-Amplifier-Manual Stored Preset You can store a preset on your UAFX pedal, and recall it using the right footswitch. All presets you store, and other artist and factory presets, are available in the UAFX Control mobile app. When you store a preset while in Live mode, the position of all knobs and switches on the pedal are saved. The preset also stores ALT knob positions, such as the alternate settings for the vibrato circuit. When you make a great sound in Live mode, storing it is as easy as holding down the ALT/AMP/STORE switch until the green PRESET footswitch LED blinks rapidly (about 0.5 When you store a preset while in Preset mode, only those knobs and switches that have changed since you loaded the preset are saved. So, when saving in Preset mode, what you hear is what is saved, and not the current positions of the knobs and switches. To store your sound as a preset Preset Notes The settings for Preset mode and Live mode are completely independent. When you move a knob or switch in Preset mode, the settings for the sound immediately jump to the new knob or switch position. You can view and audition all of your pedal\u2019s presets with the UAFX Control mobile app. Presets can only be stored when the pedal is not bypassed. Set your sound as you want it stored in the preset.

Volume Adjusts the amp\u2019s gain. As you increase volume, the character of the amp changes, becoming more overdriven and compressed. When the volume knob is set at the minimum, you will still hear sound from the pedal. The minimum level has been adjusted to provide the lowest amount of usable volume that the original hardware can provide. As you turn the volume knob up, the output volume is automatically adjusted to compensate. Note: This is the volume control on the original amp. For clean \u201cpost-amp\u201d volume adjustments, use the Output control. Cut Reduces high frequencies by filtering the power amp. As you rotate this knob clockwise, the amp tone becomes darker. Note: The range of the Cut knob has been adjusted to more easily find the 'sweet spot' for this control. The original hardware had a narrow range where the Cut knob had an audible effect. The amount of available Cut EQ is identical to the original amp, but the usable range for this knob has been expanded. Output Adjusts the output level from the pedal. When the Output volume is set at noon (running direct or into other pedals), it will be roughly the same level as your bypassed volume. 23/05/2025, 11:35 UAFX Ruby '63 Top Boost Amplifier Manual \u2013 Universal Audio Support Home https://help.uaudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/6433175606420-UAFX-Ruby-63-Top-Boost-Amplifier-Manual Output volume allows you to set the level for your setup. This control is not available on the original amplifier. Bass / Room Adjusts two different settings, depending on the position of the Alt / Amp / Store switch. AMP mode: Reduces the low frequency response of the amp\u2019s tone stack on the Brilliant channel only. ALT mode: Adjusts the amount of room tone mixed into the signal. Notes and tips Room amount only affects your sound when you use a speaker cabinet. When the speaker cabinet is bypassed, Room has no effect. The Speaker LED blinks rapidly to indicate the knob is inactive. Set Room to noon for a good starting point, and add or remove room to taste. Setting Room fully off is like recording your amp in an isolation booth. Turning up the Room knob adds ambience from the room microphones set up in the tracking room of a studio. There is no fully wet Room sound. Treble / Speed Adjusts two different settings, depending on the position of the Alt / Amp / Store switch. AMP mode: Reduces the high frequency response of the amp\u2019s tone stack on the Brilliant channel only. ALT mode: Adjusts the amp\u2019s vibrato speed. Notes The Bass and Treble knobs only work with the Brilliant channel, as with the original hardware. 23/05/2025, 11:35 UAFX Ruby '63 Top Boost Amplifier Manual \u2013 Universal Audio Support Home https://help.uaudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/6433175606420-UAFX-Ruby-63-Top-Boost-Amplifier-Manual The Bass and Treble knobs cut bass and treble frequencies as you rotate them clockwise (in effect, they work in reverse of most EQ knobs). As with the original tube amp, vibrato is only available when the Vibrato channel is selected. Bass and Treble use notes The bass and treble knobs are extremely interactive. When bass and treble are turned all the way up (all the way to the left), the midrange is reduced and the bass and treble are increased in a very extreme \u201csmiley-face\u201d EQ curve. Turn bass and treble up to around noon for more midrange and a more natural, flatter and fuller tone. A lot of usable sounds can be found by adjusting the bass and treble knobs to similar positions.

Speaker Type LED The currently selected speaker cabinet is indicated by this LED. A red LED indicates that the effect printed on the pedal is selected. A bonus speaker cabinet is selected when an LED is green (the bonus speaker cabinets don't have labels). When the LED is off, the amp is active but no speaker cabinet simulation is applied. Tip: When playing through a real guitar amplifier and speaker cabinet, you might want to bypass the speaker cabinet emulation by pressing the pedal's Speaker switch until its LED is unlit. Alt / Amp / Store In AMP mode, the standard knob controls are available for the amp. In ALT mode, room amount and vibrato speed and intensity controls are available on the Bass, Treble, and Boost knobs. To store a preset, press and hold the ALT/AMP/STORE switch in the down position until the green PRESET footswitch LED blinks rapidly (about 0.5 seconds). Channel Ruby '63 includes three channels, each of which provides different amp character and features. The boost type is also unique to each channel. Use the Channel switch to select the amp\u2019s input channel, and the Boost knob to push the input of the amp for more added gain. See Ruby '63 Channels for more details about the channels. NORMAL is based on the classic '61 \u201cnon-top-boost\u201d amplifier. The Boost knob adds gain from a germanium treble booster circuit to the amp\u2019s input. BRIL is the amp\u2019s Brilliant channel, based on the classic '63 \u201ctop-boost\u201d amplifier. The Boost knob adds gain from the preamp of an EP-III tape echo. 23/05/2025, 11:35 UAFX Ruby '63 Top Boost Amplifier Manual \u2013 Universal Audio Support Home https://help.uaudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/6433175606420-UAFX-Ruby-63-Top-Boost-Amplifier-Manual VIB is the amp\u2019s vibrato channel, based on the classic '63 \u201ctop-boost\u201d amplifier.

    "Here are four Q&A pairs that focus on synthesis, evaluation, critical thinking, and higher-order cognitive skills:\n\nQ: How do the different operating modes of the UAFX Ruby '63 Top Boost Amplifier (Live and Preset) affect the pedal's behavior and functionality? Can you provide an example of a situation where each mode would be useful?\n\nA: The UAFX Ruby '63 Top Boost Amplifier operates in two modes: Live and Preset. Live mode allows for real-time adjustments to the pedal's settings, whereas Preset mode stores and recalls pre-set configurations. Live mode is useful for experimenting with different settings and making adjustments on the fly, whereas Preset mode is ideal for saving and recalling specific tones or settings for specific songs or genres. For example, a guitarist might use Live mode to create a unique tone for a solo and then store it as a Preset for future use.\n\nQ: What are the benefits and limitations of using the UAFX Ruby '63 Top Boost Amplifier's \"hot rod\" treble booster feature? How might a guitarist use this feature to enhance their tone?\n\nA: The \"hot rod\" treble booster feature adds a high-gain, aggressive tone to the pedal's output. This can be useful for creating a bright, biting tone that cuts through a mix. However, it may also introduce a loss of low-end response and dynamics. A guitarist might use this feature to add a high-gain, overdriven tone to their sound, particularly in a rock or metal context. However, they should be cautious not to overdo it, as excessive treble boost can result in a harsh, unnatural tone.\n\nQ: How does the UAFX Ruby '63 Top Boost Amplifier's speaker cabinet emulation feature affect its overall tone and performance? Can you provide an example of a scenario where this feature would be particularly useful?\n\nA: The speaker cabinet emulation feature allows the pedal to simulate the sound of different speaker cabinets, including those from iconic British amps like the Vox AC30 and Fender Bassman. This can be useful for creating a more authentic tone that matches the speaker cabinet used in the original recording. For example, a guitarist might use the speaker cabinet emulation feature to recreate the sound of a classic rock recording, such as Led Zeppelin's \"Stairway to Heaven,\" which was recorded using a Vox AC30.\n\nQ: What are the implications of using the UAFX Ruby '63 Top Boost Amplifier's bypass feature? How might a guitarist use this feature to enhance their tone",
    "Here are 4 Q&A pairs that focus on synthesis, evaluation, critical thinking, and higher-order cognitive skills:\n\nQ: How do the settings for Preset mode and Live mode affect the way you store a preset on the Ruby '63 Top Boost Amplifier?\nA: When storing a preset in Preset mode, only the knobs and switches that have changed since you loaded the preset are saved, which means you'll hear the exact sound you want saved when you store it. In contrast, storing a preset in Live mode captures the entire sound, including the current knob and switch positions. This allows for greater flexibility when creating and storing custom sounds.\n\nQ: How does the Cut knob on the Ruby '63 Top Boost Amplifier differ from the original hardware?\nA: The Cut knob on the Ruby '63 Top Boost Amplifier has a wider range of adjustment compared to the original hardware, making it easier to find the \"sweet spot\" for tone. This adjustment allows for more flexibility and tone-shaping options, while maintaining the same level of tone quality as the original hardware.\n\nQ: What are the implications of the Bass and Treble knobs being interactive and working in reverse of most EQ knobs on the Ruby '63 Top Boost Amplifier?\nA: The interactive nature of the Bass and Treble knobs means that adjusting one knob can affect the other, creating a unique and complex tone-shaping experience. Working in reverse of most EQ knobs also requires a different approach to tone-shaping, as traditional EQ boosts and cuts are not applicable. This requires the user to think creatively and experiment with different settings to achieve the desired tone.\n\nQ: How does the Output control on the Ruby '63 Top Boost Amplifier differ from the volume control on the original amp?\nA: The Output control on the Ruby '63 Top Boost Amplifier is a post-amp volume adjustment, whereas the volume control on the original amp is a pre-amp volume adjustment. This means that the Output control can be used to adjust the overall output level of the amp, while the volume control on the original amp affects the gain and tone of the amp itself.",
    "Here are 4 Q&A pairs that aim to help someone learn and understand the material:\n\n**Q: What are the main differences between AMP and ALT modes in the Ruby '63 Top Boost Amplifier?**\nA: In AMP mode, the standard knob controls are available for the amp, while in ALT mode, room amount and vibrato speed and intensity controls are available on the Bass, Treble, and Boost knobs. Additionally, in ALT mode, the Boost knob adjusts the vibrato intensity.\n\n**Q: How do the Bass and Treble knobs interact with each other in the Ruby '63 Top Boost Amplifier?**\nA: The Bass and Treble knobs are extremely interactive and work in reverse of most EQ knobs. When both are turned all the way up (to the left), the midrange is reduced, and the bass and treble are increased in a very extreme \"smiley-face\" EQ curve. To achieve a more natural, flatter, and fuller tone, turn them up to around noon.\n\n**Q: What is the purpose of the Boost/Intensity knob in the Ruby '63 Top Boost Amplifier?**\nA: The Boost/Intensity knob adjusts the amount of boost applied to the amp circuitry. In AMP mode, it adjusts the amount of gain added to the amp's input. In ALT mode, it adjusts the vibrato intensity. By setting the Boost to OFF, you can bypass the boost circuit, and by setting Intensity to OFF in ALT mode, you can bypass the vibrato circuit on the Vibrato channel.\n\n**Q: What are the three channels available in the Ruby '63 Top Boost Amplifier, and what is the unique feature of each channel?**\nA: The three channels are NORMAL, BRIL, and VIB. The NORMAL channel is based on the classic '61 \"non-top-boost\" amplifier and adds gain from a germanium treble booster circuit to the amp's input. The BRIL channel is the amp's Brilliant channel, based on the classic '63 \"top-boost\" amplifier, and adds gain from the preamp of an EP-III tape echo. The VIB channel is the amp's vibrato channel, based on the classic '63 \"top-boost\" amplifier, and adds clean boost to the amp's input.",
    "Here are 4 Q&A pairs that require synthesis, evaluation, critical thinking, and higher-order cognitive skills:\n\nQ: What is the primary function of the Ruby '63 Top Boost Amplifier's boost knob, and how does it impact the overall sound of the amp?\n\nA: The primary function of the boost knob is to increase the amount of gain to the input of each channel, which enables the amp to produce a cleaner, more articulate sound. By rotating the boost knob clockwise, the player can adjust the gain level to suit their playing style and tone preferences. However, if the boost knob is turned all the way down to OFF, the boost circuitry is disabled and has no effect on the amp's color and gain.\n\nQ: How do the different speaker cabinets and mic settings in the Ruby '63 Top Boost Amplifier affect the overall sound and tone of the amp, and which one might be suitable for a player who prefers a brighter, more aggressive sound?\n\nA: The speaker cabinets and mic settings in the Ruby '63 Top Boost Amplifier offer distinct tonal variations that cater to different playing styles and preferences. The speaker cabinets include the 15W Celestion Silver Bulldog, Original Celestion Blue Bulldog, and Modern Celestion G12Hs, each with its unique tone and characteristics. The mic settings include a High end warmth and sheen, Classic speaker with more high end and chime, and more midrange honk and tamer highs. For a player who prefers a brighter, more aggressive sound, the Blue Mod 2x12 cabinet with modern Blue Bulldog speakers and mic'd with a Brighter and with more chime, clarity, and jangle might be a suitable option.\n\nQ: What are the key differences between the Brilliant channel and the other channels in the Ruby '63 Top Boost Amplifier, and how does the Vibrato circuit work in this channel?\n\nA: The Brilliant channel is based on a '63 \u201ctop-boost\u201d amplifier and incorporates an extra tube for more gain and more treble. This channel has less headroom before breakup and more gain overall compared to the other channels. The Vibrato circuit is disabled in the Brilliant channel, whereas in other channels, it can be toggled on and off using the footswitch. The Brilliant channel also has its own EQ settings, including Cut, Bass, and Treble knobs, which can be adjusted to fine-tune the tone.\n\nQ: How can the UAFX Control mobile app be used to customize the operation of"

Live mode allows for real-time adjustments to the pedal's settings, whereas Preset mode stores and recalls pre-set configurations. Live mode is useful for experimenting with different settings and making adjustments on the fly, whereas Preset mode is ideal for saving and recalling specific tones or settings for specific songs or genres. For example, a guitarist might use Live mode to create a unique tone for a solo and then store it as a Preset for future use.",

This can be useful for creating a more authentic tone that matches the speaker cabinet used in the original recording.
